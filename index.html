			Differentiate Environments With Different Favicons</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sally has been tasked with making the commenting feature in her company&rsquo;s
webapp be threaded up to 5 levels instead of only 2 levels. As she makes
adjustments to the code, she collects an unprecedented number of browser tabs.
Some of them point at her company&rsquo;s production site, while others point at her
development environment. In many of them, she enabled &ldquo;super-user&rdquo; mode, so she
could more freely play with her app while making her changes.</p>

<p>So she goes on coding and messing with the data for most of the afternoon.
She&rsquo;s about ready to wrap up and head home for the evening when her boss walks
in and asks, &ldquo;Sally, lots of comments have gone missing. Do you know what
happened?&rdquo; Sally felt like she had swallowed a sack of doorknobs. In the midst
of her coding spree, she mixed up some of her browser tabs and accidentally
deleted live data. A lot of live data.</p>

			Integrating Bower With Rails</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We tend to prefer convention over configuration, so when we first began using
<a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to manage our front-end dependencies, we started with minimal
configuration. While this nicely put the files in the expected places, it was a
hassle actually using the assets in our Rails app.</p>

<p>Our basic initial approach was to symlink the assets that we wanted to
reference from the <code>bower_components</code> directory into <code>vendor/assets</code> where
Sprockets would notice them. While this worked in the short term, it was
tedious to set up new packages, and was likely to break if the required assets
were moved when upgrading dependencies.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this felt like a hack. We decided that there must be a better way.
Thankfully there is.</p>

			Sassy Progressive Enhancement</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A mobile-first approach to design can be good: it helps you focus and
potentially simplify your requirements, which can translate into a better user
experience. Likewise, a mobile-first approach to implementation can be good: it
puts the more expensive tasks on the shoulders of clients that are more likely
to be able to handle the extra load, which can also translate to a better user
experience.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.causes.com">Causes</a>, we have been building things with a mobile-first approach both
in terms of design and implementation with a goal of progressive enhancement.
Since switching to this mode on the technical side, we have noticed that our
code is easier to write and more coherent to read, both of which are big
benefits for the engineering team.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve put together a little project that helps us write readable media
queries in this way. We call it <a href="https://github.com/causes/sass-enhance">sass-enhance</a>.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;How fast are your tests?&rdquo;.  Have you ever had that question? Probably not.
Does performance matter for tests? Yes, and here&rsquo;s why: The time it takes from
you changing a bit of code until you get feedback on whether or not that code
works is crucial in knowing if your code is good or not. Let me illustrate by
two scenarios.</p>

		<p>Giving structure to an agile engineering team is hard. You want people to work

working groups can come into play.</p>

			How to Avoid Designing at the Water Cooler</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently had an experience I expect is common for designers who work at startups: I presented a well-polished mockup to a key stakeholder late in the design phase of a project and he told me flat out that the design didn’t address his users’ needs. This, after I’d met with him twice before.</p>

<p>This was my first project at my new company and I was still getting to know everybody and their roles, but excuses aside, I quickly realized this happened because my team never got our business stakeholders together at the beginning of the project. Because we didn’t make time to discuss the problem we were trying to solve, everybody was operating under their own assumptions. If we were going to improve communication on our next project, my product manager and I needed to discuss how to set expectations about our design process; we needed to be more intentional about when we got feedback from which groups of stakeholders, and what kind of feedback we were seeking from each group. If we were successful, we’d be able to get consensus quicker and reduce iterations needed to get to a solution that was ready to be specced.</p>

			Managing Side-effects With the Pub-Sub Model</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over time, large-scale object-oriented systems tend to produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God
Objects</a>. These are classes which know
too much or do too much. They have connections to disparate and varied parts of
the system. They depend on everything, and everything depends on them. They make
systems slow to work with, intractable and hard to modify. They insidiously
undermine and resist our efforts to carry out our core task as engineers:
decomposing complex problems into smaller subproblems that are more easily
solved.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> there are some concepts that are
front-and-center in our product: users, their campaigns and the actions
they create to make an impact (things like petitions, fundraisers and pledges).
The concepts are so core that they have a tendency to become God Objects unless
we diligently work to prevent them accruing more and more functionality.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve lately applied the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">Pub-Sub</a>
(Publish-Subscribe) model to our Ruby code, applying the familiar event-based
patterns that we know from JavaScript to the server side, in an effort to reduce
the tight coupling that some of these God Objects have to other parts of the
system. With a simple, framework-agnostic Ruby library, we&rsquo;ve been able to
significantly tame some of the complexity around these classes, and we&rsquo;ve
released it as a Ruby gem, <a href="https://github.com/causes/pubsubhub">PubSubHub</a>.</p>

			Showing Color Chips From Sass Variables</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we like to make our code more maintainable by building reusable
components. Part of this strategy includes <a href="http://joelencioni.com/blog/2013/03/16/10-easy-ways-to-craft-more-readable-css/#two-or-more-use-a-for">assigning variable names to hex
colors using Sass</a>. This allows us to more easily reuse the same colors
everywhere, which improves consistency and makes it easier to re-color the
entire site when our design needs change.</p>

<p>To increase the visibility of these reusable components, we&rsquo;ve been building
out a collection of things that designers and engineers can reference, drop in
to projects, and iterate upon. The code sits next to the rendered version,
allowing people to easily see the implementation required to produce the
result. We call this collection the component gallery. It helps us do more with
less code, be more consistent, and iterate on global changes more easily and
effectively.</p>

<p>When we started fleshing out the color variables we wanted to use throughout
the site, it seemed natural to show these colors in the component gallery as
Pantone color chips. That way, designers could reference the colors that we are
using, we&rsquo;d have a single place to see that all of the colors look great next
to each other, and engineers could easily pluck variable names when
implementing designs to match the mocks.</p>
