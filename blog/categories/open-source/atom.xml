    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you worried that your CSS changes will break the current design in
unexpected ways? Do you want to show a designer a page you&rsquo;ve been working on,
before and after your changes? Do you want to be able to quickly look back at
how things looked a month or a year ago?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/trotzig/diffux">Diffux</a> [dɪˈfjuːz] is a tool that generates and manages visual diffs of web
pages, so that you can easily see even the subtlest effects of your code
modifications.</p>

<h2>Visualizing change</h2>

<p>A scary part of writing CSS on a large website is that when changing styles on
one page, you might unknowingly break styles on another page. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(computer_programming)">action at a
distance</a>
problem is something that most people who write CSS have come across. With this
in mind we came to conclude that an automated diff tool that compared the look
of a page before and after a change would be very helpful. Manually comparing
page after page is just too time-consuming.</p>

<p>We use Diffux to diff a large number of pages on our website
(<a href="https://www.causes.com/">causes.com</a>) after every deploy. It has helped us find style
regressions and bugs that we would have never found with a manual review
process.</p>

<h3>An example Diffux diff</h3>

<p>This is an example of a before and after snapshot of the Diffux UI
(Diffux runs in a browser, so we use it internally in the project too &ndash;
Inception style). The snapshot on the left is before our change, the snapshot
on the right is after our change and in between we have the generated visual
diff of the two snapshots. First, try to spot the difference by just looking at
the before and after snapshots. It&rsquo;s almost impossible. Now look at the visual
diff and look for anything in magenta. It reveals that the icons in the top
right corner of the thumbnails have changed slightly. <a href="https://github.com/trotzig/diffux/commit/564b520846825f6dea3770828d6c477aea8957cf">This commit
message</a>
explains more about what changed.</p>

<h2>Support for responsive diffs</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.causes.com/">Causes.com</a> is a responsive website which means that it adapts to the
available screen size of your device. On mobile, you&rsquo;ll be presented with a
(mostly) one-column layout. On your laptop, we use more of your screen estate
by using a sidebar and flowing things left-to-right. This is why <a href="https://github.com/trotzig/diffux">Diffux</a>
allows you to specify a list of viewport widths to use when taking snapshots.
Diffs are generated for each viewport, so you can easily see what effect your
changes had on a page in many screen sizes.</p>

pixels):</em></p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Before deciding to build <a href="https://github.com/trotzig/diffux">Diffux</a>, we scanned the open source market for some
alternatives. <a href="https://github.com/bslatkin/dpxdt">Dpxdt</a> looked promising, so we gave it a spin. It got the job
done, but the project looked abandoned (6 month old PRs hadn&rsquo;t received any
attention, last commit was in August 2013) and we couldn&rsquo;t get the test suite
to run locally. Plus, <a href="https://github.com/bslatkin/dpxdt">Dpxdt</a> is written in Python, and we are no Python
experts. So there was a bit of a hurdle in debugging and adding functionality.</p>
