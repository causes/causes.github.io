			Working With Asynchronously Loaded JavaScript Objects</a>

		<p>Telling browsers to load large JavaScripts asynchronously can significantly
improve performance. This prevents the browser from blocking the rendering of
the page, allowing it to be viewed more quickly. However, if you are loading
dependent files asynchronously, such as a third-party service&rsquo;s API, making the
scripts work together is not automatic.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we use Facebook&rsquo;s large (nearly 60 <abbr
title="Kibibytes">KiB</abbr> gzipped) JavaScript API on our pages. Although
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/#loading">they recommend loading it
asynchronously</a>,
we were already putting our JavaScript at the bottom of the page and weren&rsquo;t
convinced that async would give us much additional benefit. However, after some
non-scientific performance tests it appeared that switching to asynchronously
loading the Facebook API could reduce the time to <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> by nearly
a full second on our pages.</p>

			10 Easy Ways to Craft More Readable CSS</a>

		<blockquote><p>Always code as if the [person] who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.

<p>Diving into a large, old piece of CSS typically is neither easy nor
pleasurable. I find that <strong>the biggest challenges in working with old CSS often
lie in understanding the purpose and interactions of the styles</strong>.</p>

<p>When styling new elements, we have the entire context of the implementation
immediately available, and it is easy to write styles that make sense to us at
that very moment. However, in a few weeks or to a fresh pair of eyes, what made
a lot of sense at first might end up being a lot more cryptic. Without a clear
understanding of the purpose and interactions of the styles, modifying
stylesheets can be dangerous, tedious, and cumbersome. Therefore, it is
important to communicate enough context so that future developers will be able
to grok the code easily and make informed decisions.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com/">Causes</a>, we have adopted the following practices
which we believe have improved the maintainability of our stylesheets, reduced
bugs, and increased developer velocity. When you have finished reading this, I
hope that you will have a few more tools to help move your codebase toward
greater maintainability.</p>

			Even Faster: Loading Half a Billion Rows in MySQL Revisited</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few months ago, I wrote a post on loading 500 million rows into a single
innoDB table from flatfiles. This was in the effort to un-‘optimize’ a premature
optimization in our codebase: user action credits were being stored in monthly
sharded tables to keep the tables small and performant. As our use of the code
changed, we found more and more that we had to do a query for each month to see
if a user had taken an action. We implemented some performance optimizations
(mainly memcaching values from prior months as they are immutable), but it was
still overly complicated and prone to bugs. Since we had another table that was
900m rows, it seemed reasonable to collapse these shards into one 500m row
table.</p>

<p>Since writing the last post, I’ve learned that there’s a much quicker way to
combine those tables — as long as you already have the data in MySQL. MySQL
allows for selecting from one table into another via the <code>INSERT INTO ..
SELECT</code> statement:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">dest_table</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">values</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">values</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">source_table</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which might look something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">credits_new</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">activity_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">created_at</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">activity_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">created_at</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">credits</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This shouldn’t be surprising; an ALTER TABLE on an innoDB table creates a new
table with the new schema and copies the rows from the old table over to the
new table.</p>

			Loading Half a Billion Rows Into MySQL</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Background</h2>

<p>We have a legacy system in our production environment that keeps track of when
a user takes an action on Causes.com (joins a Cause, recruits a friend, etc).
I say legacy, but I really mean a prematurely-optimized system that I&rsquo;d like
to make less smart. This 500m record database is split across monthly sharded
tables. Seems like a great solution to scaling (and it is)&mdash;except that
we don&rsquo;t need it. And based on our usage pattern (e.g. to count a user&rsquo;s total
number of actions, we need to do query N tables), this leads to pretty severe
performance degradation issues. Even with memcache layer sitting in front of
old month tables, new features keep discovering new N-query performance
problems.  Noticing that we have another database happily chugging along with
900 million records, I decided to migrate the existing system into a single
table setup. The goals were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce complexity. Querying one table is simpler than N tables.</li>
<li>Push as much complexity as possible to the database. The wrappers around the
month-sharding logic in Rails are slow and buggy.</li>
<li>Increase performance. Also related to one table query being simpler than N.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Alternative Proposed Solutions</h2>

<p><em>MySQL Partitioning:</em>
This was the most similar to our existing set up, since MySQL internally
stores the data into different tables. We decided against it because it seemed
likely that it wouldn&rsquo;t be much faster than our current solution (although
MySQL can internally do some optimizations to make sure you only look at
tables that could possibly have data you want). And it&rsquo;s still the same
complexity we were looking to reduce (and would further be the only database
set up in our system using partitioning).</p>

<p><em>Redis:</em>
Not really proposed as an alternative because the full dataset won&rsquo;t fit
into memory, but something we&rsquo;re considering loading a subset of the data into
to answer queries that we make a lot that MySQL isn&rsquo;t particularly good at
(e.g.  &lsquo;which of my friends have taken an action&rsquo; is quick using Redis&rsquo;s built
in <code>SET UNION</code> function). The new MySQL table might be performant enough that it
doesn&rsquo;t make sense to build a fast Redis version, so we&rsquo;re avoiding this as
possible premature optimization, especially with a technology we&rsquo;re not as
familiar with.</p>
