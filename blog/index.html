			Sassy Progressive Enhancement</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A mobile-first approach to design can be good: it helps you focus and
potentially simplify your requirements, which can translate into a better user
experience. Likewise, a mobile-first approach to implementation can be good: it
puts the more expensive tasks on the shoulders of clients that are more likely
to be able to handle the extra load, which can also translate to a better user
experience.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.causes.com">Causes</a>, we have been building things with a mobile-first approach both
in terms of design and implementation with a goal of progressive enhancement.
Since switching to this mode on the technical side, we have noticed that our
code is easier to write and more coherent to read, both of which are big
benefits for the engineering team.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve put together a little project that helps us write readable media
queries in this way. We call it <a href="https://github.com/causes/sass-enhance">sass-enhance</a>.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;How fast are your tests?&rdquo;.  Have you ever had that question? Probably not.
Does performance matter for tests? Yes, and here&rsquo;s why: The time it takes from
you changing a bit of code until you get feedback on whether or not that code
works is crucial in knowing if your code is good or not. Let me illustrate by
two scenarios.</p>

		<p>Giving structure to an agile engineering team is hard. You want people to work
on the things that they are most interested in without losing focus on the main
goal of building a great product. No matter how you split your organization
into teams, you will miss covering certain areas of interest. This is where
working groups can come into play.</p>

			How to Avoid Designing at the Water Cooler</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently had an experience I expect is common for designers who work at startups: I presented a well-polished mockup to a key stakeholder late in the design phase of a project and he told me flat out that the design didn’t address his users’ needs. This, after I’d met with him twice before.</p>

<p>This was my first project at my new company and I was still getting to know everybody and their roles, but excuses aside, I quickly realized this happened because my team never got our business stakeholders together at the beginning of the project. Because we didn’t make time to discuss the problem we were trying to solve, everybody was operating under their own assumptions. If we were going to improve communication on our next project, my product manager and I needed to discuss how to set expectations about our design process; we needed to be more intentional about when we got feedback from which groups of stakeholders, and what kind of feedback we were seeking from each group. If we were successful, we’d be able to get consensus quicker and reduce iterations needed to get to a solution that was ready to be specced.</p>

			Managing Side-effects With the Pub-Sub Model</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over time, large-scale object-oriented systems tend to produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God
Objects</a>. These are classes which know
too much or do too much. They have connections to disparate and varied parts of
the system. They depend on everything, and everything depends on them. They make
systems slow to work with, intractable and hard to modify. They insidiously
undermine and resist our efforts to carry out our core task as engineers:
decomposing complex problems into smaller subproblems that are more easily
solved.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> there are some concepts that are
front-and-center in our product: users, their campaigns and the actions
they create to make an impact (things like petitions, fundraisers and pledges).
The concepts are so core that they have a tendency to become God Objects unless
we diligently work to prevent them accruing more and more functionality.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve lately applied the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">Pub-Sub</a>
(Publish-Subscribe) model to our Ruby code, applying the familiar event-based
patterns that we know from JavaScript to the server side, in an effort to reduce
the tight coupling that some of these God Objects have to other parts of the
system. With a simple, framework-agnostic Ruby library, we&rsquo;ve been able to
significantly tame some of the complexity around these classes, and we&rsquo;ve
released it as a Ruby gem, <a href="https://github.com/causes/pubsubhub">PubSubHub</a>.</p>

			Showing Color Chips From Sass Variables</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we like to make our code more maintainable by building reusable
components. Part of this strategy includes <a href="http://joelencioni.com/blog/2013/03/16/10-easy-ways-to-craft-more-readable-css/#two-or-more-use-a-for">assigning variable names to hex
colors using Sass</a>. This allows us to more easily reuse the same colors
everywhere, which improves consistency and makes it easier to re-color the
entire site when our design needs change.</p>

<p>To increase the visibility of these reusable components, we&rsquo;ve been building
out a collection of things that designers and engineers can reference, drop in
to projects, and iterate upon. The code sits next to the rendered version,
allowing people to easily see the implementation required to produce the
result. We call this collection the component gallery. It helps us do more with
less code, be more consistent, and iterate on global changes more easily and
effectively.</p>

<p>When we started fleshing out the color variables we wanted to use throughout
the site, it seemed natural to show these colors in the component gallery as
Pantone color chips. That way, designers could reference the colors that we are
using, we&rsquo;d have a single place to see that all of the colors look great next
to each other, and engineers could easily pluck variable names when
implementing designs to match the mocks.</p>

Henry</a></cite> holds a steel
driver in contest with a steam-powered hammer, casting human excellence against
the progress of technology. Henry is a folk hero, but he dies betting against
technology. The point isn&rsquo;t that technology wins, though — we don&rsquo;t really
lose when technology wins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a technologist, but I&rsquo;m not in it for the tech — I&rsquo;m in it for making
things that make things better. Code is an unreasonably effective lever. It
sounds syrupy to say it, but I believe that computers are the best way for me
to make the world better. They work faster and more tirelessly than I could.
Bits travel the world freely, providing value to people I will never meet.
Things I wrote 10 years ago are still doing useful work, and they may continue
to do so after I am gone.</p>

<p>But there is a gap in society. Technologists are seen as wizards, in the
Matrix. Sometimes they are shown as heroic, nerdy, or villainous, but always
unassailably &ldquo;other&rdquo;. Normal people don&rsquo;t do this thing. Normal people feel
disenfranchised by technology. Some people feel it&rsquo;s useful but don&rsquo;t see
themselves ever producing with it. Very few people see technology for what it
really is: a tool for your use. People often suppose that tech sophistication
is a function of generation — that there was a web generation, a mobile
generation, that the next generation will get it better.</p>

<p>I disagree. Tech is changing more rapidly, not less, while our ability to
incorporate the new capabilities into our practices, norms, and laws is staying
constant. Each generation&rsquo;s youth get a head start on incorporating new things
because early in life everything is new — we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">fewer bad patterns to
match</a>. But the faster
the strides of tech, the more quickly youth&rsquo;s head start is overtaken. But we
can choose not to be John Henry.</p>

<p>It would help everybody if we worked to close this gap, and casting the gap as
generational does real harm because it encourages waiting while we might act.</p>

			Overcommit: The Opinionated Git Hook Manager</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a>, we care deeply about code quality.  We
promote thorough, offline code review through
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a> and take pride in each commit we
make. Due to the sheer volume of code review and the number of engineers on our
team, it&rsquo;s important that by the time other engineers review our code we have an
established baseline of quality.</p>

<p>There are a few important ingredients to making a good commit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Correctness: The code does what you expect it to do</li>
<li>Commit message: Tim Pope provides an excellent summary of <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">what makes a good
commit message</a></li>
<li>Style: The code matches our team&rsquo;s coding styles</li>
<li>Test coverage: relevant tests have been run, and any new features have spec
coverage</li>
</ul>


<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/causes/overcommit">overcommit</a>. This evolved from a
single file linter into a full-fledged, extensible hook architecture.  Available
as a Ruby gem:</p>

<pre><code>gem install overcommit
</code></pre>

<p>What does it do? In short, it automates away all the tedium before a commit
reaches code review. It ships with a set of opinionated lints that ensure a
level of consistency and quality in our commits.</p>

<h2>In Action</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of overcommit saving me from committing janky code:</p>

<pre><code>❯❯❯ echo "eval('alert(\"hello world\")');" > eval.js
❯❯❯ git add eval.js
❯❯❯ git commit
Running pre_commit checks
  Checking causes_email...........<span class="success">OK</span>
  Checking test_history...........<span class="warning">No relevant tests for this change...write some?</span>
  Checking restricted_paths.......<span class="success">OK</span>
  Checking js_console_log.........<span class="success">OK</span>
  Checking js_syntax..............<span class="error">FAILED</span>
    eval.js: line 1, col 1, eval can be harmful.

    1 error
  Checking author_name............<span class="success">OK</span>
  Checking whitespace.............<span class="success">OK</span>

<span class="error">!!! One or more pre_commit checks failed</span>
</code></pre>

		<p>Telling browsers to load large JavaScripts asynchronously can significantly
improve performance. This prevents the browser from blocking the rendering of
the page, allowing it to be viewed more quickly. However, if you are loading
dependent files asynchronously, such as a third-party service&rsquo;s API, making the
scripts work together is not automatic.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we use Facebook&rsquo;s large (nearly 60 <abbr

<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/#loading">they recommend loading it
asynchronously</a>,
we were already putting our JavaScript at the bottom of the page and weren&rsquo;t
convinced that async would give us much additional benefit. However, after some
non-scientific performance tests it appeared that switching to asynchronously
loading the Facebook API could reduce the time to <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> by nearly
a full second on our pages.</p>
